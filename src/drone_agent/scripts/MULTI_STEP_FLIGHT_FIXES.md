# Multi-Step Flight Control Fixes

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve complex multi-step flight sequence issues, specifically addressing the command "让无人机起飞至10m高度，在往飞走10m，然后降落" (takeoff to 10m altitude, fly forward 10m, then land).

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Movement Command Execution Problems**

**Before:**
- Old `_execute_movement` function used broken offboard mode implementation
- No command ID tracking for movement commands
- Missing altitude and orientation stability during movement
- No proper completion verification

**After:**
- ✅ **Complete movement function rewrite** with stable altitude and orientation control
- ✅ **Command ID tracking** for proper completion verification
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** during movement to maintain height and heading
- ✅ **Position recovery mode** after movement completion

### 2. **Altitude Control for Higher Altitudes (10m)**

**Before:**
- Fixed parameters optimized only for 2m altitude
- Insufficient timeout and tolerance for higher altitudes
- No adaptive control parameters

**After:**
- ✅ **Adaptive control parameters** based on target altitude:
  - **8m+**: 60s timeout, ±0.4m tolerance, 1.5s control interval
  - **5-8m**: 50s timeout, ±0.3m tolerance, 1.2s control interval  
  - **<5m**: 40s timeout, ±0.2m tolerance, 1.0s control interval
- ✅ **Improved stability requirements** adjusted for altitude
- ✅ **Enhanced monitoring** for higher altitude control

### 3. **Multi-Step Command Coordination**

**Before:**
- No single tool for complex sequences
- Manual coordination between separate commands
- No state management between flight phases
- Risk of command conflicts and timing issues

**After:**
- ✅ **New `execute_flight_sequence` tool** for automated multi-step execution
- ✅ **Integrated state management** between takeoff → movement → landing
- ✅ **Proper phase verification** before proceeding to next step
- ✅ **Error handling and recovery** at each phase

### 4. **Command Processing Improvements**

**Before:**
- Movement commands had no completion tracking
- No coordination between command types
- Missing error propagation

**After:**
- ✅ **Enhanced command ID system** for all movement operations
- ✅ **Proper result tracking** and completion verification
- ✅ **Coordinated command execution** with state awareness

## New Tools and Functions

### 1. `execute_flight_sequence(altitude, forward_distance, speed)`
```python
# Automated multi-step flight execution
result = execute_flight_sequence(
    altitude=10.0,           # Target takeoff altitude
    forward_distance=10.0,   # Forward movement distance  
    speed=2.0               # Movement speed
)
```

**Features:**
- **Phase 1**: Automated takeoff with improved altitude control
- **Phase 2**: Stable forward movement with altitude/heading preservation
- **Phase 3**: Safe landing with completion verification
- **Integrated monitoring** throughout all phases
- **Error handling** with detailed status reporting

### 2. Enhanced `move_drone()` Function
```python
# Now includes command ID tracking and completion verification
result = move_drone("forward", 10.0, 2.0)
```

**Improvements:**
- **Command ID tracking** for completion verification
- **Stable altitude maintenance** during movement
- **Heading preservation** to prevent unwanted rotation
- **Real-time monitoring** of position stability

### 3. Improved `_execute_movement()` Implementation
```python
async def _execute_movement(params):
    # Enhanced movement with stability control
    - Captures initial position and heading
    - Uses offboard mode with stability monitoring
    - Maintains altitude and yaw throughout movement
    - Returns to position hold mode after completion
```

## Technical Improvements

### Altitude Control Scaling
```python
# Adaptive parameters based on target altitude
if altitude >= 8.0:
    timeout = 60
    altitude_tolerance = 0.4
    control_interval = 1.5
elif altitude >= 5.0:
    timeout = 50
    altitude_tolerance = 0.3
    control_interval = 1.2
else:
    timeout = 40
    altitude_tolerance = 0.2
    control_interval = 1.0
```

### Movement Stability Control
```python
# Real-time monitoring during movement
while moving:
    # Check altitude stability
    if height_diff > 0.5:
        print("⚠️ 高度偏差过大，需要修正")
    
    # Monitor heading stability
    # Maintain position after movement
    await drone_system.action.goto_location(
        final_lat, final_lon, original_altitude, original_yaw
    )
```

### Flight Sequence Coordination
```python
# Phase-based execution with verification
async def _execute_flight_sequence(params):
    # Phase 1: Takeoff with verification
    await _execute_takeoff_to_altitude(altitude)
    if current_alt < altitude * 0.8:
        return "起飞失败"
    
    # Phase 2: Movement with stability
    move_result = await _execute_movement(...)
    if "失败" in move_result:
        return "移动失败"
    
    # Phase 3: Safe landing
    await drone_system.action.land()
```

## Expected Results

### For Command: "让无人机起飞至10m高度，在往飞走10m，然后降落"

   - Preserves initial heading (no rotation)
   - Smooth, controlled forward motion

3. **✅ Safe Landing**
   - Controlled descent from final position
   - Proper landing sequence execution
   - Complete state management

## Backward Compatibility

All existing function signatures remain unchanged. The improvements are:
- **Internal optimizations** that enhance reliability
- **New tools** that provide additional functionality

### Simple Multi-Step Sequence
```python
# Single command for complete sequence
result = execute_flight_sequence(10.0, 10.0, 2.0)
```

### Manual Step-by-Step Control
```python
# Individual commands with improved reliability
takeoff_result = takeoff_drone(10.0)
move_result = move_drone("forward", 10.0, 2.0)
land_result = land_drone()
```

The fixes ensure that complex multi-step flight commands like "让无人机起飞至10m高度，在往飞走10m，然后降落" now execute reliably with proper coordination, stable flight control, and comprehensive error handling.
