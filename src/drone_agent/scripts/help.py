            ROSA - Robot Operating System Agent
            Embodiment: Drone/UAV Control System
            Environment: ROS2 Humble + MAVSDK

            ========================================

            Usage: Use natural language to control the drone safely
                   Example: "arm the drone and take off to 10 meters"
                   Example: "move forward 5 meters then rotate 90 degrees"

            Description: AI-powered drone control agent that translates natural

            - Emergency landing capability
            - Status monitoring and reporting
            - Sequential command execution
            - GPS and home position verification

            - Arming/disarming
            - Takeoff and landing
            - 3D movement control
            - Rotation and heading control
            - Hovering and position hold
            - Manual control inputs
