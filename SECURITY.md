## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open an issue in the 
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/rosa/issues).

If you would prefer to disclose the issue in a discrete manner, please send an email 
to [Rob.Royce@jpl.nasa.gov](mailto:Rob.Royce@jpl.nasa.gov).

Vulnerability reports will be investigated on a case-by-case basis and either accepted
or declined. Once a vulnerability report is accepted, our team will determine the
best course of action for patching.
